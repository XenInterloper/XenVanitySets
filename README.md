# Xen's Vanity Sets
This is an extremely simple mod I made for my friends and I to give us custom vanity sets and look dapper.
Feel free to download it yourself if you really want to use one of them, but be warned:

- Since this is just a thing for my friends and I, I will not be actively maintaining it, and;
- None of the sets have crafting recipes, so you will need to use a spawn menu mod to get them.

This repository is not actively maintained; I do all my work off-site, and let tModLoader handle the rest. Check the mod browser for up-to-date information, patch notes, etc.
